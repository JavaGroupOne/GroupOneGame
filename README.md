								    GROUP ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVE
Create a quiz competition application with at least ten questions. You may use a button to check the response of the user and the next button to get a new question. The questions must be randomized from your selection, but should be all from the same topic. 

Some Guidelines:
	• Create a variable to keep track of the score and output your results on a label on your form. 
	• Create a file menu to EXIT, CLEAR ANSWERS, OR START OVER.
	• comment code
	• use proper programming style.
	• include a header in all applications

PROJECT MEETING SCHEDULE & ATTENDANCE:
Meeting November 3, 2018 

Attendees:
	• Collette Hibbert
	• Fayon McCalla
	• Jodiann Allen
	• Michkail Barton
	• Shanika Ferguson
	• Andrew Graham


Meeting Notes:

	• Confirmed Tool (Eclipse and BlueJ)
	• Decision made to ennable this quiz application with three subject area, facilitating 15 questions each.
	• All progress and action items will be enabled in the Readme file component of the application


	• Design concept & Action items:
	The team agreed to do a dashboard look and feel with grid selection. quality and enhanced imagery to enable 
	a unique presentation look and feel with all practical and functional compnents incorporated.A mapping of the design
	was accomplish. Subjects confirmed are Mathematics, Information Technology and Science.

		• Andrew: To obtain all Q&A for the subject areas. Design and images to materialise next step concept model of the application.
	
		• Fayon: To work on the name of the application and welcome script for the application
	
		• Shanika: To establish anoverview of the competition and for the about us window

		• All other: To think about the concept, do reasearch and be prepared for the next meeting to drill further into the project 
		based on the below concept details:


						******************************************
						MOCKUP IMAGE RELAYED (CANNOT BE DISPLAYED IN TXT)

	The above is just a sample image of what the dashboard would look like. Each block will represent a selection option. 
	Additionally, the header/selection text would be present – the image such as a test tube would represent Science, 
	computer would represent It, logout will be an exit door etc..

	The above is not the final image, it is just a representation of what we are looking to achieve. Above it would be the competition logo etc.


	• Guest Dashboard: this is just the dashboard view before user login. transitioning between windows need to be seamless

		o Register
			1. To capture users full name, ID#, username and password
			
		o Login
			1. Allow users to login for access to testing facility
			2. Acurately record score progress
		o Competition Status
			1. This will list the names of all the users with the highest scores in the respective subjects (first second and third for each)
		o Prizes
			1. This will display all the prize that will be issued to the first, second and third place winners of the competition

		o Winners!
			1. This WILL display the winners of the competition.
			2. The winners have to complete all three subjects successfully

		o About
			1. This will provide information around the team and the practical use of the quiz
		o Exit
			1. This closes the program



	• User Dashboard: this is the dashboard view when a user login

		o Once user login is completed the below selection appear in colored square blocks. Also, the name of the user should be displayed.
			1. Math
			2. Information Technology (IT)
			3. Science
			4. Performance Review: This will present all tests completed for the user currently logged in. It will show the score obtained
			5. About: When selected it will show the about write up with the readme html built in at the bottom – once selected it will 
				  automatically open the readme text file. A “return” to menu button should be enabled, or “back” to take the user 
				  back to the screen.
			6. Logout: Prompt by name: “John Doe” are you sure you want to logout (y/n)? If yes, it takes the user back to the main menu.
				   If no, it remains on the existing menu screen
			7. Exit: This closes the program



	• Completion of test:
		o Username, ID and score to be noted
		o Score: This is left blank until the test is completed, this will display the score in percentage


Agreed Meeting Schedule going forward:

	• Meeting Schedule:
		o November 3, 2018 Kick-off (1 meeting – 8pm)
		o November 10, 2018 Follow-up (2 meetings – 10am & 8pm)
		o November 17, 2018 Follow-up (2 meetings – 10am & 8pm)
		o November 24, 2018 Follow-up (2 meetings – 10am & 8pm)
		o November 25, 2018 Follow-up (1 meeting – 8pm)
		o November 28, 2018 (Code finalized) - (1 meeting – 8pm)

Meeting November 17, 2018 

Attendees:
	• Fayon McCalla
	• Collette Hibbert
	• Garie Austin
	• Andrew Graham
	• Jodiann Allen

Meeting Summary:
	Pulse check taking along with run through of progress made to date. Research is ongoing. We have agreed that the concept is much more 
	complex than we had though and as such requires a lot of time invested as we want to accomplish the vision of the application we agreed on.
	Jodiann presented the code draft of the dashboard look in contrast to the concept. We are confident that the delivery will be achieved with quality.

									THE APPLICATION
									  GAMBROSIJAC
								  Pronounced Game-Bro-Zi-Yak

 	
14 Classes created for the program to work as expected - see below:


1.	About  		
2.	ITtest 		
3.	LoginDB 		
4.	MainDashboard 	
5.	MathTest		
6.	Prizes		
7.	Register		
8.	ReportCard		
9.	ScienceTest		
10.	Status.java 	
11.	UserDashboard
12.	Welcome
13.	Winners 	
14.	sqliteConnection



Testing of the respectve class was aggresssive to ensure the integration of the codes worked seamlessly. Additionally, excess codes, variables and imported 
files were cleaned to enable an error free program.

The solution is practical, as it allows for registration and login capabilities to track performance. The team would have preferred not to highlight questions 
that are correctly, however we thought it best to stick with the Lecturers' guideline.

The man hours that went into coding this application was not being tracked, however we can say it was significant with a number of sleepless nights due to 
continuous research by the team.

We are proud of the application we have collaborated on and the quality it presents.
